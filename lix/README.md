# Lix 

Lix is a change control system optimized for running in the browser.

A change control system allows tracking, querying, and reviewing changes in data structures (not just files). For example, given a spreadsheet, a change control system allows you to see who changed what and when. It also allows you to query the data at any point in time. For example, you can ask "what was the value of cell A1 on 2021-01-01?". Or given a translation file `en.json`, a query that answers the question "Who changed the message with key `login-header`?" can be executed.

Examples of great lix apps have an "edit > review > automate" workflow:

- document editors (markdown, PDF, etc.)
- accounting solutions (auditing)
- content creation tools (Figma, Adobe Premiere)
- spreadsheets (Excel, Google Sheets)
- CAD software (Fusion 360, Autodesk)
- data science analyzation (Jupyter Notebooks)
