"@inlang/paraglide-js": patch
---

Removed the "Which tech-stack are you using?" prompt from the `init` command as it was not providing any real value. All it did was link you to the appropriate documentation.

From now on we rely on the docuemntation site to guide people to the correct documenation for their framework.
