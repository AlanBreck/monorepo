# Paraglide Adapter SvelteKit

> Not to be confused with SvelteKit's adapters. This is a framework integration for Paraglide.

Everything you need to internationalize your SvelteKit app with Paraglide.

**Features**

- ðŸª‚ Automatically set & manage the language for Paraglide
- ðŸ’¨ A breeze to set up - No need to change your `routes`
- ðŸª„ Automatically translate existing links
- ðŸ’¬ Translated paths
- ðŸ¤– SEO friendly out of the box

## Quickstart

There are four steps to setting up the Paraglide Adapter with SvelteKit.

1. Set up the Vite Plugin
2. Initialise the Adapter
3. Add the Adapter Component to your Layout
4. Add the Hooks.

We assume that you already have a SvelteKit app set up.

### 1. Set up the Vite Plugin

```bash
npm i -D @inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit
```

Then add the adapter to your `vite.config.js` file:

```js
import { paraglide } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit/vite"

export default defineConfig({
	plugins: [
		paraglide({
			project: "./project.inlang",
			outdir: "./src/paraglide",
		}),
		sveltekit(),
	],
})
```

This replaces the need for calling `paraglide-js compile` in your build script. It will automatically compiler and recompile your translations when you run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`.

### 2. Initialize i18n routing

Create a file somewhere, for example `src/lib/i18n.js` and add the following code:

```js
import { createI18n } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit"
import * as runtime from "$paraglide/runtime.js"

export const i18n = createI18n(runtime);
```

This `i18n` instance is the heart of the adapter. It will provide you with all the functionality you need. `createI18n` is your one-stop-shop for configuring the adapter.

### 3. Set up the Language Provider

To provide the language to your app, add the `ParaglideJS` component to your layout and pass it the `routing` instance.

```svelte
<!-- src/routes/+layout.svelte -->
<script>
    import { ParaglideJS } from '@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit'
	import { i18n } from '$lib/i18n.js'
</script>

<ParaglideJS {i18n}>
    <slot />
</ParaglideJS>
```

This will do a few things for you:
1. Automatically set the language for Paraglide
2. Automatically add `rel="alternate"` links to your page head
3. Automatically translate any `<a href>` attributes on your page. You don't need to change them

### 4. Add the Reroute hook

Finally, let's add the `reroute` hook that makes it all possible. In your `src/hooks.js` file, use the `i18n` instance to add the `reroute` hook:

```js
import { i18n } from '$lib/routing.js'
export const reroute = i18n.reroute()
```

## Advanced Routing

###Â Excluding certain routes

If you have routes that you don't want to translate, you can exclude them by passing them to the `exclude` option:

```js
import { createI18n } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit"
import * as runtime from "../paraglide/runtime.js"

export const i18n = createI18n(runtime, {
	exclude: ["/admin", "/login", /^\/user\/\d+$/],
})
```

Excluded routes will:
- Not have any `rel="alternate"` links added to them
- Not have their Paths translated
- Not have links pointing to them translated

Links to non-excluded routes from excluded routes will still be translated.

### Translated Paths

With the Paraglide SvelteKit Adapter, you can have different paths for each language. For example, you can have:
- `/en/about` for English
- `/de/uber-uns` for German
- `/fr/a-propos` for French

Setting this up is easy with the `pathnames` option:

```js
import { createI18n } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit"
import * as runtime from "../paraglide/runtime.js"

export const i18n = createI18n(runtime, {
	"/about" : {
		en: "/about",
		de: "/uber-uns",
		fr: "/a-propos",
	},
})
```

> You don't need to include the language, or your site's base path. Those will be added for you.

If you now visit `/fr/a-propos` you should see the French version of your about page.

You can also use parameters in your translations. This is useful for pages that have a dynamic ID, like a user profile page. Parameters are added in square brackets.

```js
import { createI18n } from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-sveltekit"
import * as runtime from "../paraglide/runtime.js"

export const i18n = createI18n(runtime, {
	"/user/[username]" : {
		en: "/user/[username]",
		de: "/benutzer/[username]",
		fr: "/utilisateur/[username]",
	},
})
```

> You need to use all parameters in all translations. If you don't, Paraglide will not be able to use the correct path.

## Translating Links
Links are translated automatically using a preprocessor. This means that you can use the normal `a` tag and the adapter will translate it for you.

```svelte
<a href="/about">{m.about()}</a>
```

Will become:

```svelte
<a href="/en/about">{m.about()}</a>
<a href="/de/uber-uns">{m.about()}</a>
<a href="/fr/a-propos">{m.about()}</a>
```

depending on the current language.

If you want a link to be translated into a specific language, you can use the `hreflang` attribute:

```svelte
<a href="/about" hreflang="de">{m.about()}</a>
```

will become:

```svelte
<a href="/de/uber-uns" hreflang="de">{m.about()}</a>
```

You can also opt out of translation by adding a `data-no-translate` attribute.

```svelte
<a href="/about" data-no-translate>{m.about()}</a>
```

## Translating Programmatic Navigation

SvelteKit offers a few ways of navigating programmatically. Mainly `goto` and `redirect`. Unfortunately, translating these automatically is not practical. For these cases, you can use the `resolveRoute` method on the `i18n` instance.

```js
import { i18n } from '$lib/i18n.js'
import { goto } from '$app/navigation'
import { languageTag } from '../paraglide/runtime.js'

goto(i18n.resolveRoute("/about"))
```

Fortunately you don't need to do this often. Most of the time, you can use the `a` tag and the adapter will translate it for you.
