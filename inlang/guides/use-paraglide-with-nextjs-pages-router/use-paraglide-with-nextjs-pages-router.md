# Using ParaglideJS with Next.js' Pages Router

In this guide we will use [Paraglide.js](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs), [inlang-message-format](https://inlang.com/m/reootnfj/plugin-inlang-messageFormat) and [inlang's IDE Extension](https://inlang.com/m/r7kp499g/app-inlang-ideExtension).

Translated string(s) in this guide might be referred to as message(s) or translation(s).

## 1. Starting point
This guide assumes that you have a Next.js project set up, and you are using the pages router. If you don't, you can follow the [official Next.js guide](https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/installation) to get started.


## 2. Install Paraglide.js

The recommended way to install Paraglide.js is via the cli. This will create any files that are required for Paraglide.js to work and install the required dependencies.

In your project root, run the following commands:

```bash
npx @inlang/paraglide-js init
npm install
```
