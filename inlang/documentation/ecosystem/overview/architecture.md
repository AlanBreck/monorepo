# Architecture

Inlang's architecture consists of three main components:

1. [inlang Apps](/documentation/concept/app) - Provide users with an interface for their projects.
2. [SDK](/documentation/sdk) - Can be used by developers to build inlang apps.
3. [Repository (Lix)](/#lix) - Defines the project's settings, which language tags exists and to be imported modules.

### Infrastructure approach

For every use case, there is an app, a plugin, a lint rule, or a custom solution that can be built. Inlang's infrastructure powers an ecosystem of tools, applications, best practices, and automationsÂ for organizations to go global.

### Version control and automation via CI/CD

Inlang apps are built on lix. Lix is a git-compatible version control backend for applications. Using lix provides inlang with CI/CD for globalization and collaboration between developers, translators, and designers on one common source of truth: your repository and your data.
