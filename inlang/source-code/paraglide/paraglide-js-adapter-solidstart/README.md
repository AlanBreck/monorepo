# SolidStart Adapter for Paraglide JS

## Example project

Before setting up the adapter in your own project, you can take a look at the [example project](./example) to see how it works.

## Getting started

### 1. Initialize paraglide-js

If you haven't already, initialize paraglide-js in your project. To do so, follow the [getting started guide](https://github.com/inlang/monorepo/tree/main/inlang/source-code/paraglide/paraglide-js#getting-started) to get familiar with the basic paraglide concepts.

Then come back here to learn how the adapter helps you to integrate paraglide-js into your SolidStart project.

### 2. Install the adapter

```bash
npm install @inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-solidstart
# or
pnpm add @inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-solidstart
# or
yarn add @inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-solidstart
```

### 3. Use the adapter to wrap paraglide

```ts
import * as paraglide from "../paraglide/runtime.js" // generated by paraglide
import {createI18n} from "@inlang/paraglide-js-adapter-solidstart"

const { LanguageTagProvider, languageTag, setLanguageTag } = createI18n(paraglide)
```
