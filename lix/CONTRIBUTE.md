we use docker compose for development
on mac use colima: brew install colima and start the vm with the packages/colima.sh
we use port 80, you can see all available containers at http://localhost and access a specific one at http://containername.localhost, for environments without .localhost support add the damians to your /etc/hosts file as alias for 127.0.0.1
