inlang offers tailored localization products for each [use case](/#personas) (Developer, Designer, Translator). You only have to set inlang up once; then, you can use every inlang app out of the box. 

Some of the main inlang features include:

- **Decentralized workflows** - Don't force devs in a cloud solution; let devs, translator and designer work in their native environment. ([Apps](/c/apps))
- **One source of truth** - Never have syncing problems again; The data is always stored in your repo while collaborator can work on it in their own interface.
- **Quality management** - Define [Lint Rules](/documentation/lint-rule) for your project to ship quality cross-app. 
- **Automations** - With lix change control you can use CI/CD to check lint, machine translate, validate and more. (Continuous Localization)
- **Review** - PR workflows can be used to gain control over the merged content.
- **Integration** - With [plugins](/c/plugins) every project can get inlang ecosystem compatible.

## How does the ecosystem work?

Once you have set up your inlang project, you can use all the apps without any additional effort. The apps just work with the data that is stored in the repository. All the apps use lix change control, which makes it easier for multiple users to collaborate.
