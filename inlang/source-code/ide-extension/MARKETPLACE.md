## Inlang Tab - Transparent & Fast

You can have multiple projects in your repository. By using the inlang tab, it's easy to switch between projects. Whenever you change the source text, translations from the resource files will be automatically updated. Additionally, the tab menu provides a quick overview of any project errors in the setup.

## Let's get started

### Step 1: Initiate a New Project

> Skip this step if you have already created a project.

Open Sherlock within Visual Studio Code and click the `Getting Started` button. This will automatically create a new project for you.

### Step 2: Customize Your Project

After the project is created, you can customize it to fit your specific needs:
- Click on the settings wheel icon next to your project name in the Sherlock panel to access customization options.
- Modify your `project.inlang/settings.json` as needed to configure translation settings and add any specific plugins or lint rules.

### Additonal Steps

#### Storage module

Install a plugin that reads and writes your messages from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/plugins) ‚Äì the standard template uses the inlang message format plugin, but we also have plugins for `i18next` and `JSON` & more.

#### Syntax matcher 

Install a syntax matcher/function matcher from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/plugins) ‚Äì the standard template uses the `m` function matcher, but we also have plugins for `t` function matcher, a `next-intl` matcher and more. 

> The `i18next` module already includes a syntax matcher.

#### Lint rules

Install [lint rules](https://inlang.com/c/lint-rules) to find errors in your translations from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/lint-rules)


## Usage

Just _highlight/select_ the text you want and hit `cmd .` or `ctrl +` (Quick Fix / Yellow Bulb) to open the **translate dialog** to provide an id for it.

Hover over the message to see the tooltip with the translation.

## Customization

### Custom preview language

You can customize the preview language in the settings. This is useful if you want to see how your translations look in a specific language. This setting is also available in the bottom status bar.

```json
"sherlock.previewLanguageTag": "de"
```

### Custom extension colors

You can customize the colors for inline annotations directly through the VS Code settings JSON file. This feature allows you to set different colors for `info` and `error` states, enhancing the readability and usability of inline annotations.

Add the following properties to your `settings.json` file to customize annotation colors:

```json
"sherlock.editorColors": {
	"info": {
		"foreground": "#color",
		"background": "rgba(number, number, number, 0.2)", // needs transparency
		"border": "#color"
	},
	"error": {
		"foreground": "#color",
		"background": "rgba(number, number, number, 0.2)", // needs transparency
		"border": "#color"
	}
}

// or (for all extensions)

"workbench.colorCustomizations": {
	"editorError.foreground": "#color",
	"editorError.background": "#color",
	"editorError.border": "#color",
	"editorInfo.foreground": "#color",
	"editorInfo.background": "#color",
	"editorInfo.border": "#color"
}
```

### Disable Inline Annotations

You can disable inline annotations by setting the following property to `false` in your `settings.json` file or by using the command `Sherlock: Toggle Inline Annotations`. The default value is `true`.

```json
"sherlock.inlineAnnotations.enabled": false
```
