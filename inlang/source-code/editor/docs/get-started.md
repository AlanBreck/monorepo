# Let's get started

1. Add a `project.inlang` folder to your repository
2. Create a `settings.json` file to that new dir `project.inlang/settings.json`
3. Install a plugin that reads and writes your messages from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/plugins)
---
4. **Optional** Install [lint rules](https://inlang.com/c/lint-rules) to find errors in your translations from the [inlang marketplace](https://inlang.com/c/lint-rules)

Look at the [example repository](https://github.com/opral/example) and it's [settings.json](https://github.com/opral/example/blob/main/project.inlang/settings.json) for a working example.

## Example

This is how the editor could look like for your project:

<doc-links>
    <doc-link title="Open inlang example" icon="icon-park-outline:editor" href="/editor/github.com/opral/example" description="inlang example repository in the editor"></doc-link>
</doc-links>
